# YACR (Yet Another Copr Repository)

This is a Copr repository for free/non-free packages that don't have the privilege of receiving auto-updates.

## Installation Instructions

To install this Copr repository simply run,

```txt
dnf copr enable -y zliced13/YACR
```

## Package Requests

If you want to request a new package to be added, create a new issue using the **package-request** template.

If the requested package already works fine in other package managers (such as 
AM (App Manager), HomeBrew, Nixpkgs, Flatpak, and Snap) then it most likely not be added unless
there is a really good reason for why it should be added this COPR repository.
